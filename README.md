# scribble

Scribble is an add on library for [blcairo](http://github.com/bit101/blcairo) to draw graphics as if they were scribbled.

Many parameters are available to alter the look and feel of the scribble, from small tight loops to widely meandering random lines.

A selection of shape drawing functions also exist, such as lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles. More to come.
